/*
1. Convert Character to Int.
    By Casting:
        
        In this case, the ASCII equivalent of the character will be displayed.
        ----------------------------------------------------------------------
        
        To convert an ALPHABET to int:
        
        char a = 'A';
        int num = int(a); // returns the ASCII equivalent of 'A' which is 65...
        
        To convert a NUMBER CHARACTER to int:
        
        char a = '2';
        int num = a - 48; 
        
        Here, 48 is the ASCII value of 0. 
        
        What is done here is the second line a-48 implicitly converts char a to its ASCII equivalent and then subtracts it from 48 (50-48) that results in integer value 2.
